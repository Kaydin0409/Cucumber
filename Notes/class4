*Recap*
    -->Cucumber options in runner class:
        **dry run: to quickly get the step definitions
            -Whenever we write a new scenario in feature file, we must set dryRun to true for step definitions and
            then put this definition under steps package.
           -After writing the code in it, set dryRun to false, and execute the script
        **monochrome: removes irrelevant information
            -Whenever we set monochrome to true, it removes irrelevant information or unreadable characters from console
             while executing cucumber test cases

    -->Hooks: for entire project
        **pre-condition: @Before
        **post-condition: @After
            -We must keep Hooks class under steps package

    -->Background: common steps in a feature file until flow is not broken
        -it is applicable only to 1 feature file, every file can have a different background

    -->Tags: to categorize our scenarios for execution
        -can have multiple tags for scenarios --use 'and' or 'or' operators
        -smoke, regression, sprint#, etc.
        -tags can also be used for Feature, but more commonly used for scenarios

    -->Data Driven Testing: When we execute our script against multiple sets of data
