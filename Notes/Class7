**Recap**

--Screenshots and Reports

    *Method for screenshots available in Common Methods
    *It will be used for every scenario
    *For screenshots in Cucumber it accepts only array of Byte
    *We are passing the path of saving screenshots from constants class
    *We are passing the FileName from scenario.getName() (shown in Hooks)
    *Scenario class in cucumber holds complete information of execution
    *We are using getTimeStamp() method to get the time in specific format so we can add it in the name of the screenshot

    *We want to generate a report that can have a screenshot in it
    *Add plug-in to pom.xml

    *Rerun plugin we use this plugin in runner class to capture the details of failed test cases during execution
     and then we use failed runner class to execute only failed test cases

     In intellij clean under maven project deletes target folder

        *For cloud executions*
     To run the code from cmd/terminal: open up explorer to project, then enter cmd in file path to open terminal

     mvn clean = to clean the project
     mvn test = to execute the scripts
     mvn clean verify -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@tagname" to override the tag from cmd (Don't need to change tags in intelliJ runner class)
