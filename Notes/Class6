    ==>Examples Table: Hooks and Background work multiple times, depending on number of data sets in scenario
    ==>Data Table: Hooks only execute one time, background only time. We use data table to achieve data driven testing

    2 Types of data tables:
    *With header: List<Maps<>> because key, value pairs exist: key is header, value is other cell values
    *Without headers: List<> only

    Excel File/Spreadsheets: Another form of data-driven testing

    Homework: modify the details of the employee after adding it in the HRMS
