Recap:
    *Architecture of Framework
        1) 1st package of Framework: Utils --> to keep all the utilities of our project, such as constants, config reader,
           common methods, etc. to reuse them
        2) Steps package --> all step definitions can be found under this package from the gherkin steps we used in
           feature file
        3) Pages package --> allows us to implement POM (Page Object Model). Implement object repository and functions
           Must use Selenium PageFactory to initialize all the elements through a Constructor
        4) Runners package --> we use runner class to execute all test cases


For pre condition and post condition in cucumber we have 2 annotations that are called Hooks:
    1) @Before
    2) @After
    *Hooks should always be mentioned under steps package

    ==>Background vs hooks
    **Hooks are applicable to all feature files
    **Background is applicable to just one feature file\

    Hooks execute first then background executes then scenario executes and in the
    end hooks executes again as post condition
