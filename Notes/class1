Cucumber: Class 1

*Cucumber--> a tool that supports Behavior-Driven Development(BDD)

    Scenario Keywords:
    *Given: pre-condition
    *When: to perform actions
    *And: supporting tag
    *Then: expected result/outcome



Script Examples:

US - 12345 - search employee by name
Given user is able to open chrome browser
When user enters username and password
And user clicks on login button
Then user is navigated to dashboard page
When user clicks on PIM option
And user clicks on employee list option
When user enters name in the employee name field
And user clicks on search button
Then user is able to see the employee

2345 - Search employee by id
Given user is able to open chrome browser
When user enters username and password
And user clicks on login button
Then user is navigated to dashboard page
When user clicks on PIM option
And user clicks on employee list option
When user enters id in the employee id field
And user clicks on search button
Then user is able to see the employee

**Cucumber encourages code re-usability concept**

*Main: the code we write to develop the application is written under main folder. Main folder not needed. Keep framework clean
    -Develop the application: 1 type of code
    -Test the application: Another type of code

*Test: the code we write to test the application is written under test folder.

==>2 things we have in every project:
1) Coding/java
2) Non-coding/non-java: properties file, excel, etc.

Coding will be at one place, non java will be at another place

*To Write Gherkin Scenarios, we use feature files


Valid Admin Login:
Given user is navigated to HRMS application
When user enters admin username and password
And clicks on login button
Then admin user is successfully logged in

*Every Scenario is considered as one test case

Why we do not need System.SetProperty():
If the path is incorrect to webdriver, it will fail. Path is limited to one machine
Many times it is not compatible with browser

We Use WebDriverManager from now on
